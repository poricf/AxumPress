    <h2>About AxumPress</h2>
    <p>
      AxumPress is the static site generator that powers this website. It was born from a challenge by my mentor to build my own blogging platform, and it quickly grew into a passion project for learning Rust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core philosophy is simplicity and control. It's a command-line first tool that turns simple Markdown files into a complete, fast, and deployable website. It uses some of the best tools in the Rust ecosystem, including the Askama templating engine for type-safe HTML and the Axum web framework for its live preview server.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're curious to see how it all works, the entire project is open source.
