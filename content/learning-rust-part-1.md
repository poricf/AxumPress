# Learning Rust: Part 1

Welcome to my Rust journey! In this first part, Iâ€™ll share why I started learning Rust and my first impressions.

## Why Rust?
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Great performance
- Modern tooling and package manager (Cargo)

## First Steps
I installed Rust using rustup and wrote my first `Hello, world!` program. The compiler is strict, but the error messages are super helpful!

## What I Like So Far
- The community is friendly
- The documentation is excellent
- Ownership and borrowing are new, but make sense

Stay tuned for Part 2!
